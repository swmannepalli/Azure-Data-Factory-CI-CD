**ðŸ“¢ Introduction**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to follow along with the ADF DevOps integration lab exercises, you need to provision a set of resources. One for Dev and one for Prod as the lab demonstrates deployment from Dev to Production. This module will help you to create following resources: <br />
 	
+ Dev and Prod Resource Groups - This is the container that will hold all related resources in our Azure solution.
+ Dev and Prod ADLS Gen2 - This is the source in Data Factory copy activity
+ Dev and Prod Azure Data Factory - This is where sample data factory pipeline will be hosted. we will set up Git Integration for DEV ADF to host all objects in Azure Repos to implement version control.
+ Dev and Prod Azure SQL Database - This is the destination/sink in Data Factory copy activity
+ Dev and Prod Azure KeyVault - This is where we will be storing Azure Storage Account access key and SQL Database connection string as secrets. 

ðŸ¤” Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. An Azure account with an active subscription. Note: If you don't have access to an Azure subscription, you may be able to start with a free account. All below resources should be created in your own subscription.
2. You must have the necessary privileges within your Azure subscription to create resources, perform role assignments, register resource providers (if required), etc.
3. All the resources can be deployed in NonProd/Prod Subscription.
