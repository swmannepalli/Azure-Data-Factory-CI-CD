**ADF DevOps Workshop**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this workshop we work on implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment for Azure Data Factory using Azure DevOps. In Azure Data Factory, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) means moving Data Factory pipelines from one environment (development, test, production) to another. Azure Data Factory integrates with both Github and Azure DevOps Git for source control (For this lab, we're focussing on Azure DevOps Git). Git is a version control system that allows for easier change tracking, collaboration among developers and maintain history. 

**Note:** This lab requires a good understanding of Data Factory including creating Copy Activities, Linked Services, DataSets as we only focus on DevOps integration part.
