**ADF DevOps Workshop**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this workshop we work on implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment for Azure Data Factory using Azure DevOps. In Azure Data Factory, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) means moving Data Factory pipelines from one environment (development, test, production) to another. Azure Data Factory integrates with both Github and Azure DevOps Git for source control. Git is a version control system that allows for easier change tracking and collaboration.  For this lab, we're focussing on Azure DevOps Git. Main objective of source control is to have collaboration among developers, track changes and maintain history. 

**Note:** This lab requires a good understanding of Data Factory including creting Copy Activities, Linked Services, DataSets as we only focus on DevOps integration part.
